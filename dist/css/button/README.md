# Button

The core CSS Button is broken down into several subsets in order to allow using to include / exclude specific css.

(index can be used to consume all)

 - `button.css`: core functional / structural components of the layout
 - `kind-*.css`: extended functionality based on button 'styles'
 - `compact.css` /  `animation.css`: extension to add animations and other non-core features
 - `theme-base.css`: core bindings for `theme` specific code (using `var(--theme-XYZ)` abstraction)
